## HOW TO USE

1. **Choose the right category** based on what you want to accomplish
2. **Find a relevant prompt** that matches your specific need
3. **Customize the prompt** by replacing placeholders like [code], [functionality], [use case]
4. **Add your specific context** - paste your actual code, describe your requirements
5. **Use with your AI assistant** - Copy the customized prompt to Cursor or any AI coding tool

## PLACEHOLDER GUIDE

- `[code]` - Replace with your actual code snippet
- `[functionality]` - Replace with specific function description
- `[use case]` - Replace with your specific scenario
- `[error message]` - Replace with actual error text
- `[concept A/B]` - Replace with specific concepts you want to compare
- `[system/application]` - Replace with your project context

## EXAMPLE USAGE

Instead of: "Fix my code"
Use: "Debug this function that's throwing a NullPointerException. Here's the relevant code: [paste your code]"

Instead of: "Make this faster"  
Use: "Optimize this algorithm to improve time complexity from O(n¬≤) to O(n log n): [paste your algorithm]"

## TIPS FOR BETTER RESULTS

‚úÖ **Be Specific**: The more specific your context, the better the AI response
‚úÖ **Include Code**: Always paste relevant code when asking for help
‚úÖ **State Goals**: Clearly explain what you're trying to achieve
‚úÖ **Mention Constraints**: Include performance, security, or other requirements
‚úÖ **Ask Follow-ups**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification or alternatives

## COMBINING PROMPTS

You can combine prompts from different categories:
- Generate code + Review for quality
- Debug issue + Optimize performance  
- Learn concept + Apply in architecture
- Refactor code + Add comprehensive tests

## LANGUAGE AGNOSTIC

These prompts work with any programming language. The AI will adapt the response based on:
- Code you provide
- Context clues in your project
- Explicit language specification if needed

Happy coding! üöÄ
